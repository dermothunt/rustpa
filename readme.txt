RUSTPA v0.1

An Android app (at first - iOS support is planned) designed to assist Rust players with the boring, day to day tasks of survival. Quarries, furnaces, refineries, pumpjacks... they all need efficient time management to get the most out of them. Rust PA does all the hard work for you, letting you get on with the important business of base defence, raiding, and PVP! 

Currently a work in progress. Hoping to have this in testing very soon.
